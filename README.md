The game consists of several levels where a player has to eliminate all blocks present by hitting them with a ball which bounces against 3 walls and a paddle controlled by the player.
As the player progresses in levels, the ball's speed increases and the paddle gets shorter. A person can have 2 types of accounts:

# Admin Account
Allows the user to design games, specifying the desired number of levels, the number of blocks per level as well as their colors and placement, initial paddle length, and initial ball speed. The admin can save his/her settings and return to them later upon restarting the application until the game is ready to be published. Once it is published, a game cannot be modified or deleted. 

# Player Account 
Gives the user access to the list of all published games he/she is able to play. The user can open multiple sessions of the same published game which will be saved for him/her to continue later upon restarting the application at a later date.
